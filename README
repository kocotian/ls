Linux Script
============

Linux Script is a simple programming language
based on Linux x86_64 system calls.

This repository contains programs like:
- LinuxScript Compiler (lsc) - for compiling LinuxScript Code

LinuxScript Compiler is in very early stage for now, even
cannot handle files. To use compiler you must give LS code to
stdin, and assembly code will be printed to stdout. Also, nasm
compiler is for now required to assemble compiled program.
Example usage:
$ lsc < program.ls > program.asm && nasm -felf64 -o program.o program.asm && \
	ld -o program program.o && ./program

Example program is shown below.

A language syntax is similar to B or early C syntax.
This is simple programs which do nothing, but it will compile
using both LinuxScript compiler and C compiler (C compiler may generate
warning):

main(void)
{
}

Compile with command shown above.
